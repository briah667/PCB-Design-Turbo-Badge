# PCB-Design-Turbo-Badge
Custom PCB design using Digilent's mascot, Turbo. Oscillator circuit to blink LED when correctly assembled. 
This was my first PCB design project; I used KiCad and OSH Park. A wearable badge with an oscillator circuit to blink an LED. 
The design requirements were that it would operate on a 3V cell battery and the LED would light up only when the arms were soldered on correctly.
That meant the circuit had to be open at each of the "arm pits", each node branched to the arm to another node to complete the circuit.
The custom outline with break away tabs were also a design requirement.
